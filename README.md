## Repository structure

This repository contains two main components:

- **R code** — Scripts to run the tidal interpolation function, which estimates tide heights at 1-minute intervals. The function implements the formula provided by the Servicio Hidrográfico y Oceanográfico de la Armada (SHOA) for tide prediction and interpolation.
- **data** — Tide tables for the port of Ancud in January 2018, obtained from SHOA.

## Project status

Finalized.

## Organization

Developed as part of my PhD in the Bird Ecology Lab (BEL).
